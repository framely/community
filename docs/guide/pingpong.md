# Quick Start with PingPong 
> Follow this PingPong chatbot to get started with OpenCUI.

This guide will walk you through using OpenCUI platform to build, test and deploy a simple PingPong chatbot. When interacting with this chatbot, a user can get a greeting message, and a response *"pong"* to input message *"ping"*. For example:

:::: conversation
::: bot Bot
Hi! I'm a virtual PingPong chatbot. How can I assist you today?
:::
::: user User
Ping
:::
::: bot Bot
Pong. What else can I do for you? 
:::
::: user User
No, thanks
:::
::: bot Bot
Thank you for contacting the virtual PingPong chatbot. Have a great day! 
:::
::::

After this simple PingPong chatbot, you can easily build **the first level of CUI** [frame without slot](./5levels-cui.md#frame-without-slot) and manage how the messages are presented to users per your own business logic. For example, if you are a restaurant, you can let your users check your business hours as following:

:::: conversation
::: bot Bot
Hi! I'm a virtual Restaurant chatbot. How can I assist you today?
:::
::: user User
What is your hours?
:::
::: bot Bot
We open every day from 10:00am to 9:00pm. Can I help you with anything else? 
:::
::: user User
No, thanks
:::
::: bot Bot
Thank you for contacting the virtual Restaurant chatbot. I am glad I could help you today. Good-bye!

Now, let's begin:

## Before You Begin


Before you start with this guide, it is recommended that you go through these following list first:
1. Get familiar with [the basic idea of building conversational apps](README.md).
2. [Sign up](../reference/platform/signingup.md) for OpenCUI account.

## Create Chatbot
After you log in, there will be an org *(short for organization)* automatically created for you. You can select this org to create chatbots. Here, the org with label `me.quickstart` will be selected:

![org list](/images/guide/pingpong/orglist.png)
:::

To create a chatbot (If you are already inside a chatbot, you can skip these steps): 

1. Inside an org, head to chatbot list page by clicking **Chatbots** in the left side menu, then click the **Create** button on the right side.

   ::: thumbnail
   ![create chatbot](/images/guide/pingpong/create_chatbot.png)
   :::

2. After clicking the **Create** button, there will be a pop-up window. You should complete the form for basic chatbot settings, here you only need to care about the **Project Label**, **Region** and **Add language**. All of them can be modified after creation except the **Region** field:
   - Enter your chatbot's label in the **Project Label** field, start with lowercase, for example `pingpong`.
   - Select your preferred **Region**.
   - Select the languages for your chatbot in the **Add Language** field.

   ::: warning Need To Know
   - When you create a chatbot, you must specify a region. For the best performance, you should choose a region that is near your services and end-users. 

   - Once a chatbot is created, you can not change its **Region**. In order to change a chatbot's region, you must export or clone a new one with a different region.

## Build Chatbot

The service that a pingpong chatbot can provide is just a simple question-and-answer dialogue. Such frame is typically communicated in one sentence and conversations are done in a single turn. As the service provided by pingpong does not need to collect informations from a user, like booking a flight ticket requires departure time, departure place, destination, etc, chatbot at this level is just a set of [skills](/guide/concepts.md#skills) and its dependency. 

Therefore, we will skip the [describe service at schema level](getting-started.md#1-describe-services-at-schema-level) phase and start with interaction declaration. This section walks you through the steps to build the pingpong chatbot.

### Declare Interaction

What is the interaction provided by this pingpong chabot? The answer is to give a response *"pong"* to the user's message *"ping"*. So all you have to do in the declare interaction phase is to add a response to one skill at **STRUCT** *(short for structure)* level which represents the **interaction layer**. For more information about each of the layers, see [Separation of Concerns](README.md#separation-of-concerns) and [4 Layers of Chatbot](glossary.md#chatbot).

For each chatbot, you can create many skills. But in this case, you only need one. 

1. Click into the [pingpong](#create-a-chatbot) chatbot, stay at **STRUCT** level.

   ::: thumbnail
   ![struct level](/images/guide/pingpong/struct_level.png)
   :::

2. To create a skill, click **Create** button on the right side.

   ::: thumbnail
   ![create intent](/images/guide/pingpong/create_intent.png)
   :::

3. Enter a label (e.g. `PingPong`) in the **Skill Label** field and press enter. 
   ::: warning Need To Know
   - Label is not a name, it is **identifier**, a language independent aspect for semantics in OpenCUI. 

   - As a type label, **Skill Label** should start with capital case, limited 2-100 characters, and only support letters, digits and underscores.
   :::

   ::: thumbnail
   ![intent label](/images/guide/pingpong/intent_label.png)
   :::

4. Head to **Response** tab, select **Single Value Message** at **Default Action** section for declaring a simple reply.

   ::: thumbnail
   ![add response](/images/guide/pingpong/add_response.png)
   :::

5. Once done, click **Commit** icon for propagating structure level instances to each language level. 

   ::: thumbnail
   ![commit pingpong struct](/images/guide/pingpong/commit_pingpong_struct.png)
   :::

### Fill Language Template and Exemplar

Once the declaration of the interaction is done, these language related parts become required. This makes supporting new languages very easy, all you need to do is to fill language aspects such as templates for text generation and utterance exemplars for helping dialog understanding. 

Now let's add language-related aspects:

1. Switch to language layer by selecting a language on the left side. In this case, we will switch to English side, so select **EN** in the language dropdown menu. 

   ::: thumbnail
   ![switch pingpong en](/images/guide/pingpong/switch_pingpong_en.png)
   :::

2. To fill language templates, heading to the **Responses** tab, enter `Pong` in the **Single Value Message** field at **Default Action** section and press enter. 

   ::: thumbnail
   ![pingpong simple reply](/images/guide/pingpong/pingpong_simple_reply.png)
   :::

3. To fill utterance exemplars for helping dialog understanding, heading to the **Expression** tab: 
   - In the **Names** section, enter `Ping Pong` for the pingpong skill display name and press enter. This field is also the examples of how this type is mentioned in different languages.
      ::: thumbnail
      ![pingpong alias](/images/guide/pingpong/pingpong_alias.png)
      :::

   - In the **Expressions** section, enter `ping` and press enter. These expression exemplars can indicate user's intention under same contexts and can be used by NLU model to hotfix the understanding issues.
      ::: thumbnail
      ![pingpong expression](/images/guide/pingpong/pingpong_expression.png)
      :::
   
4. Once you have filled all the language templates and expression exemplars, click **Commit** icon for commiting your language layer changes.

   :::

## Test Chatbot

OpenCUI provides a built-in testing feature "**Debug**" to help you to uncover bugs with the debug info, you can test your chatbot by typing messages. Let's test this pingpong chatbot, which will handle a basic conversation with a [default welcome message](concepts.md#default-skills) and response with *"pong"* to message *"ping"*. 

1. As **Debug** can only test committed content, please make sure both structure layer and language layer have been committed. 

   ::: thumbnail

## Deploy Chatbot

With Deploy action, the latest master of your chatbot can be published to production environment. And then your user can interact with this chatbot via your integrated channels. So before deploying, you need to make sure your chatbot has integrated at least one channel. 

These following steps will show you how to use the extension channels provided by OpenCUI. If these are not enough, and you are good at development, you can extend any channel you need. For more information about extension, see [Native Provider](../reference/providers/native.md).

Now let's use Messenger as an example. To use this integration:

1. Select **Explore** tab at the top of this page, type `channel` in the search bar and press enter. You can use filter on the right of the search box, please select **service** to assist in filtering.
