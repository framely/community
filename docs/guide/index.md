# From Beginner to Master
OpenCUI is a platform that helps you create conversational interfaces for your services. It assumes that your services are already developed and deployed. Once you declare your services on the [platform](https://build.opencui.io), you can use a declarative approach to build the conversational interface for them.

To make the most of OpenCUI, it's important to understand its type-based conceptual model, which is different from the more common flow-based approach. We have created a series of tutorials that will guide you through the process of understanding the conceptual model and becoming skilled at using OpenCUI to create excellent conversational experiences.

#### [Sign up](signingup)
We're still in beta, so we need you to sign up before you can use our service. This will help us allocate resources and make sure you have the best possible experience. All you need is a GitHub account, and it's best if your email is verified.

#### [Clone an echo chatbot](clone-simple-chatbot)
Here's a quick way to get started: clone an existing project. This guide will walk you through the steps of cloning a simple chatbot and testing its behavior using the built-in debug tool.

#### [Build an echo chatbot](build-simple-chatbot)
This guide will walk you through the process of creating the simple chatbot that was introduced in the previous guide.

#### [Reuse a hours module](reuse-component)
Importing a module is another way to reuse existing work on OpenCUI. Modules are reusable conversational components based on their service interface. This guide will show you how to add functionality to your chatbot by reusing a module paired with a compatible provider.

#### [Build a hours module](build-module)
This guide will show you how to develop the module that were introduced in the reuse module guide.

#### [Build a hours provider](build-provider)
This guide will show you how to develop the backend/provider that were introduced in the reuse module guide.

#### [Deploy a chatbot](deploy-to-channel)
Using Messenger as an example, this guide will show you how to configure chatbot and channel so that they point to each other. Once you have completed these steps, your chatbot will be available in Messenger.

#### [Get a team](are-you-ready)
OpenCUI is a platform primarily for chatbot product managers, but to successfully operate a conversational experience, you need a team. 

#### [OpenCUI workflow](opencui-flow)
OpenCUI uses a Git-like version control system to make collaboration on projects easy. This guide will show you the workflow for using it.

For the impatient, [you can get started now](https://build.opencui.io).
