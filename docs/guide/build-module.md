# Build a simple module
On OpenCUI, a module is reusable conversational functionality. While it is possible for a module to be self-contained, modules are commonly just frontends that conversationally expose a single service, with the actual implementation of the service developed and deployed separately. Using services to decouple the frontend and backend development has many benefits and is widely adopted for building user-facing applications.

The Service is a special singleton type in a module with service enabled. It allows you to declare a set of API functions that can be directly accessed by other types. With the service declared, you can define the conversational user interface to expose these functionalities in the same module. Such a module, when paired with a compatible provider, can add conversational functionality to any chatbot with little effort.

In the previous guide, we showed how your chatbot can handle various business hours queries using the "hours" module. In this guide, we will show you how to build such a module in two parts: first declare the service, then define the conversational user interface on top of that. Both essentially involve defining a set of types, with types needed by the service requiring no dialog annotations.

## Before you start
- [Sign up](./signingup.md#sign-up) for an account and log in to [OpenCUI](https://build.opencui.io/login).
- Read [build a simple chatbot](./build-simple-chatbot.md) to learn how to build a skill with entity slots.
- Review the [example dialogue](./reuse-component.md#pick-a-full-stack-component) to get familiar with the functionality you will build here.

## Create module: hours
You need to create a module with service support, so you can solely focus on the conversational user interface, leaving the management of business information, like hours, as a separate concern.

Within an organization, in the project list page.
1. click **Create** and select **Create module**.
2. In the pop-up window, fill out the form for following basic settings and click **Create**:
   - **Project label**: enter `hours`.
   - **Languages**: add **English(en)**.
   - **Enable service interface**: turn this toggle on for service support.

## Declare service
Declaring a service means that you define the function type for each API in the service. However, in order to define these function types, you must first define the data types for their input parameters and return values, which may need to be defined recursively in case one of these data types is composite. On OpenCUI, a frame is a standard user defined composite type with support for polymorphism behaviors, and a entity is a primitive type. 

### Build frame: BusinessHours
If you require a function that returns the business hours on a specific day, you'll need to provide the following information:
- **dayOfWeek**: the day of the week, like Monday, Tuesday, etc.
- **ifOpen**: whether it's open on that day.
- **openingTime**: the time it opens.
- **closingTime**: the time it closes.

This suggests that you define a frame as type to represent the function return, since a OpenCUI frame is a standard user defined composite type.

#### Schema layer: declare a frame
At this layer, you will create a frame and add all of the required slots.

##### Create the frame
Inside the **hours** module and **Types** page, under the **Structure** view.
1. Click **Create** button on the right side, and select **Create frame** to create a new frame.
2. Enter `BusinessHours` as a label for the frame type and press enter.

##### Add slots
Inside the `BusinessHours` frame and **Schema** tab, under the **Structure** view.
1. In the **Slots** section, add a slot of type **java.time.DayOfWeek** with the default label `dayOfWeek`.
2. Back to the `BusinessHours` frame, add another slot with type **kotlin.Boolean** and change its slot label to `ifOpen`.

   ![change slot label](/images/guide/build-service/change-slot-label.png)
   :::

3. Follow the same steps to add the other two slots:
    - `openingTime` with type **java.time.LocalTime**
    - `closingTime` with type **java.time.LocalTime**

Once finished, the frame should look like this:
::: thumbnail
![show frame BusinessHours](/images/guide/build-service/show-frame.png)
:::

#### Annotate type: BusinessHours
Since this type does not need to be exposed conversationally, there is no need to add dialog annotation.

### Declare function interfaces
To retrieve business hours for a specific day or in general, we can utilize the following two API functions:
1. **getHoursDay**(date:java.time.LocalDate):BusinessHours
2. **getHoursWeek**():List\<BusinessHours\>


Inside the **hours** module and **Service** page, under the **Structure** view.
1. In the **Functions** section, click **Add**.
   - Enter `getHoursDay` as the **Function label**.
   - In the **Parameters** section, click **+** to add an input parameter. Enter `date` as a **Name** and select **Entity** > **java.time.LocalDate** as **Type**.
   - In the **Return type** section, select **Frame** > **BusinessHours** as **Type** and turn off **Nullable**, then save.

2. In the **Functions** section, click **Add**.
   - Enter `getHoursWeek` as the **Function label**.
   - In the **Return type** section, select **Frame** > **BusinessHours** as **Type**. Turn on **Multi-value**d and turn off **Nullable**, then save.

Once finished, the function interfaces should look like this:

## Build CUI for the service
To provide functionality through a conversational user interface (CUI), you need to define a skill. A skill is essentially a function type with dialog annotations, allowing the chatbot to create a callable object for triggering the service through conversation. The input parameters of the function are captured by the skill's slots, and the function's return can be displayed using its response.

As always, when building a type, you should first define its dependent types, but all the types required by the skill are already defined, so you are good.

### Build skill: ShowHours
Although there are two API functions that need to be exposed, only one skill is necessary. To determine which API functions should be grouped together, consider their simplest description without mentioning parameters or return values. If two API functions share the same description, they must be triggered by the same skill.

#### Schema layer: declare a skill
To create a skill for managing users' questions on business hours, you need to create the type, add the necessary slots and services.

##### Create the skill
Inside the **hours** module and **Types** page, under the **Structure** view.
1. Click **Create** button on the right side, and select **Create skill** to create a new skill.
2. Enter `ShowHours` as a label for the skill type and press enter.

##### Add slots
To prompt a user for a specific day, use the [DatePicker](../reference/plugins/components/datepicker) frame. This frame simplifies the process of entering a date and is an official CUI component declared in the `components` module. 

Before proceeding, ensure that the `components` module exists under the **Dependencies** tab. If it doesn't, import [components module](https://build.opencui.io/org/io.opencui/agent/components/struct/frame/63c8aea6517f06c1880e3cff) to the **hours** module first. After successful import, go back to **hours** module and refresh your webpage.

Inside the `ShowHours` skill and **Schema** tab, under the **Structure** view.

1. In the **Slots** section, add a slot of type **io.opencui.components.dataEntry.DatePicker** with the default label `datePicker`. 

2. In order to gain access to function interfaces, a service must be declared:
   - Back to the `ShowHours` skill, in the **Services** section, click **Select service** and select **IHours**. 
   - Use the default label `hours` and click **Save**.

   ![add service](/images/guide/build-service/add-service.png)
   :::

#### Annotate type: ShowHours
 Based on analysis of the desired conversational behavior and business logic, pick the right annotation to add for desired conversation experience.

##### Add slot level annotation to datePicker
When a user triggers a skill, the chatbot follows the interaction logic based on the annotations attached to the skill. For this particular skill, the desired conversational experience is as follows:
- If the user doesn't mention a specific date, the chatbot should display the business hours for the week.
- If the user provides a date, and the business is open on that day, the chatbot should show the business hours. If the business is closed, the chatbot should inform the user that it's closed.

Since the desired behavior is when the user does not mention the date, the chatbot should respond directly, you need to select **Recover only** for [fill strategy](../reference/annotations/fillstrategy.md) for this slot.

###### Interaction layer
Inside the `ShowHours/datePicker` slot and **Annotation** tab, under the **Structure** view.
- Select **Recover only** in the **Fill strategy** section.

::: tip Remember to propagate the change you made under the Structure view
- Both schema layer and interaction layer are defined under **Structure** view, but language layer is under corresponding language view, for example, for English, it should be under "Language/en".
- Before beginning work on the language layer, always [propagate](./opencui-flow.md#propagate-the-changes-to-language-layer) the changes made so far to the language layer, and then switch over to the corresponding language view.
:::

###### Language layer
Inside the `ShowHours/datePicker` slot and **Expression** tab, under the **Language/en** view.
- In **Names** section, enter the names, such as `date`.

##### Add type level annotation
For the `ShowHours` skill, only two type level annotations: names, utterance exemplars, are required.

###### Language layer
Inside the `ShowHours` skill and the **Expressions** tab, under the **Language/en** view.
1. Add names for `ShowHours` skill:
   - In the **Names** section, enter `show business hours` and press enter.
2. Add expressions for `ShowHours` skill:
   - In the **Expressions** section, enter the following content:
     - _When do you open?_
     - _Do you open  $datePicker$?_

::: warning Attention
Do **NOT** copy and paste the value wrapped by `$`. Please type the value instead.
:::

##### Configure response
The responses for this skill depend on a number of the things: whether `datePicker` slot is filled and what the returned value is. OpenCUI allows you to configure responses with or without branching. When branching is enabled, you can specify conditions to control the response of the skill. Each condition has corresponding actions, such as displaying a list of values using **Multiple value message**.

###### Interaction layer
Inside the `ShowHours` skill and the **Response** tab, under the **Structure** view.

1. To configure responses with branching, turn on **Branching**.
   ::: thumbnail
   ![add a branch](/images/guide/build-service/branching.png)
   :::

2. To show the business hours on a user-mentioned date:
   - In the **Branching** section, click **Add**.
   - Inside a branch:
      - In the **Conditions** section, copy and paste the following code:
      ```kotlin
      datePicker?.date != null && hours.getHoursDay(datePicker!!.date!!).ifOpen == true
      ```
      - In the **Action sequence** section, select **Single value message**.

3. To inform the user it's closed on a user-mentioned date:
   - Back to the **Response** tab, in the **Branching** section, click **Add**. 
   - Inside a branch:
     - In the **Conditions** section, copy and paste the following code:
     ```kotlin
     datePicker?.date != null && hours.getHoursDay(datePicker!!.date!!).ifOpen == false
     ```
   - In the **Action sequence** section, select **Single value message** and **Multiple value message**.
     - **Single value message** is used to inform the user it's closed on that day.
     - **Multiple value message** is used to display a list of business hours in a week, so the user can get additional information to make a choice.
4. If no date is mentioned, use the default branch to display business hours for each day of the week:
    - Back to the **Response** tab, in the **Default action** section, select **Multiple value message**.
    - In the **Source** section, copy and paste the following code:
   ``` kotlin
   hours.getHoursWeek()
   ```

###### Language layer
Inside the `ShowHours` skill and the **Responses** tab, under the **Language/en** view.

1. In the **Multiple value message** field, enter the following content:
     - **Header**: _Our business hours in a week are_
     - **Body**:
        - _${`it.value.dayOfWeek!!.expression()`}_
        - _${`if (it.value.ifOpen == true) it.value.openingTime!!.expression() + " ⁠– " + it.value.closingTime!!.expression() else "Closed"`}_
       
2. In the **Branching** section, click the first branch. 
   - In the **Single value message** section, enter this: _We are open on ${`datePicker!!.date!!.expression()`} from ${`hours.getHoursDay(datePicker!!.date!!).openingTime!!.expression()`} to ${`hours.getHoursDay(datePicker!!.date!!).closingTime!!.expression()`}._

3. Back to the **Response** tab, in the **Branching** field, click the second branch. 
   - In the **Single value message** section, enter this: _Sorry, but we don't open on ${`datePicker!!.date!!.expression()`}._
   - In the **Multiple value message** section, enter the following content:
     - **Header**: _Our business hours in a week are_
     - **Body**:
       _${`it.value.dayOfWeek!!.expression()`}_
       _${`if (it.value.ifOpen == true) it.value.openingTime!!.expression() + " ⁠– " + it.value.closingTime!!.expression() else "Closed"`}_

Now that you have finished building a module, you can  [create a pull request](./opencui-flow.md#create-a-pull-request), [merge it into the master](./opencui-flow.md#review-and-merge-pull-request). You can replace the module you imported with this one in the chatbot you used in the last guide, and experiment with it.
