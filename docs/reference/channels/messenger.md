# Messenger
![test](/images/channelConfig/messenger/test.png)

Using the Facebook Messenger integration, you can create a Facebook Messenger chatbot to interact with your end-users within your business. The chatbot need to be configured on the [Messenger Platform](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/introduction), so Facebook knows where to forward user messages for your chatbot to handle.

We are going to show you how to integrate Messenger with an OpenCUI chatbot in the OpenCUI production environment. For private deployment, please check with the DevOps team in your organization.

Follow these steps to configure:

## Before you begin
On the Messenger side, please ensure you have all of the following:
- **Facebook Page**: A Facebook Page will be used as the identity of your Messenger experience. To create a new Page, visit [Create a Page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/create).
- **Developer Account**: Your developer account is required to create new apps. To create a new developer account, go to the [Meta Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/) website and click the 'Get Started' button.
- **Facebook App**: The Facebook app contains the settings for your Messenger experience, including access tokens. To create a new app, visit your [app dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) and click on 'Create App' in the top right corner.

## Set up Messenger
1. Use [Meat App Dashboard](https://developers.facebook.com/apps) to add the Messenger product to your Meta App: 
   1. Enter the App you want to configure, click **Add Product** on the left sidebar menu. 
   2. Click **Set Up** button on **Messenger** product.

3. Then you will be provided with an access token at this step. In the **Access Tokens** section, click **Generate Token** button. :clipboard: Copy this value. This token will be used to configure the integration from the OpenCUI platform.

1. On OpenCUI platform, go to service component [io.opencui.channel](https://build.opencui.io/org/io.opencui/agent/channel/struct/service_schema): 
   1. Click **Import** button on the second topbar.
   2. Select the chatbot you want to configure Messenger channel and **Save**.

2. Once you have done, switch to your chatbot to wire Messenger channel:
   1. On **STRUCT** level, head to **Settings** page, in the **Integrations** tab, select the service you just import. In this case, please select **io.opencui.channel.IChannel**.
   2. A configuration dialog opens, at **Service Provider** field, select **io.opencui.messenger** to wiring Messenger channel.

   ![select the service](/images/channelConfig/overview/select-service.png)
   *Select service io.opencui.channel.IChannel*

   ![select a channel](/images/channelConfig/overview/select-channel.png)
   *Wire Messenger channel*

3. Continue inside the dialog, configure Messenger integration as following: 
   - **Label**: Enter channel label, should be **unique**.
   - **Verify Token**: Enter any private token you desire. :clipboard: Copy this value. This will be used to configure the Messenger Webhook. 
   - **Page Access Token**: Paste the access token you copied during the Facebook app setup above.
   - **Locale**: Select locale which determines the default language used by your bot.
   - **Callback URL**: :clipboard: Copy this value after setting the label and locale. This will be used to configure the Messenger Webhook.

4. Before you go to next step, don't forget to merge your changes into master and deploy your chatbot.

## Finish Messenger setup
1. Configure the Messenger webhook for your app. Back to your Meta App:
   1. Go to **Messenger > Settings** panel, scroll down to **Webhooks** section, click **Add Callback URL** button. 
   2. A Webhook setting dialog opens, use the **Callback URL** and **Verify Token** values you copied above, click **Verify and Save** button.

2. In the **Webhooks** section, click **Add subscriptions** button and enable `messages` and `messaging_postbacks` in the page subscriptions.

## Test your chatbot
1. To test that your app setup was successful, go to your page and send a message to yourself. If you get a response, you have fully set up your app for receiving messages! :tada:
2. To make the app accessible to the public, switch to [live mode](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test/app-modes#live-mode).

::: tip Two app modes in Facebook apps
- In the [development mode](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test/app-modes#development-mode), only the administrator and tester that you invited can access the app. In this case, talk to the chatbot.
- In the [live mode](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/build-and-test/app-modes#live-mode), apps can request [permissions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/permissions/reference) from anyone, but only permissions approved through [App Review](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/app-review). Click [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/app-review/) to submit your app for review.
