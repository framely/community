4. Before you go to next step, don't forget to merge your changes into master and deploy your chatbot.

## Finish Google Business Message setup
A webhook is a partner-created HTTPS callback that specifies how your agent should respond to messages and events. You can set your webhook either at the partner level or at the agent level. Partner-level webhooks apply to every agent you maintain, while agent-level webhooks each apply to one individual agent.

### Set your partner-level webhook
1. Open the [Account settings](https://business-communications.cloud.google.com/console/partner/settings?utm_source=/business-communications/business-messages/guides/quickstarts/echo-agent&utm_medium=devsite&utm_campaign=business-messages) in the Console.
2. Make sure the correct partner account is selected.
3. Set **Technical point of contact**.
4. For **Webhook**, click **Configure**.
    - For **Webhook endpoint URL**, paste the *callback URL* you copied when [adding Google Business channel](#add-google-business-channel).
    - For **Client token**, paste the *client token* you copied when [adding Google Business channel](#add-google-business-channel).
5. Click **Verify** and click **Save** in the top right corner.
