The [WhatsApp Business Platform](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp) gives medium to large businesses the ability to connect with customers at scale. You can start conversations with customers in minutes, send customer care notifications or purchase updates, offer your customers a level of personalized service and provide support in the channel that your customers prefer to be reached on.
