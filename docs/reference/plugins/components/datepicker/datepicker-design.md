# CUI design

## Usage
DatePicker component allows users to input or select a date using natural language in conversational interactions. It can recognize various ways of describing a date, such as the day of the week, day of the month, and date of the year, and will interact with the user to finalize a specific date. It is suitable for the context in which it appears. 

Common use cases include:
- Making a restaurant reservation.
- Scheduling a meeting.

Common interaction logics include:
- Ask for a date.
- Provide date options and help to shrink candidate dates.
- Pass business logic verification.
- Inform or double check with end-user the date value.
