# Version Control

[[toc]]

## Motivation

Working collaboratively with multiple team members, you probably work in a shared folder on the same set of files, which are always kept in sync automatically and instantly displaying the changes across all users' instances. It is easy to work with but operates only on single files. Meanwhile, only one user can work on a file at a time because when editing the same file at the same time, there will be conflicts. It is very easy to accidentally overwrite an important file you never meant to.

So Framely provides a [Version Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) system, which does not rely on a shared central project and allows users to maintain independent projects and communicate revisions via changesets. Everybody on the team is able to work absolutely freely on any project at any time. You know what exactly is different in these versions, your teams work faster and smarter.

For more information about providing team members with access, see [Access Control](access.md).

## Working with Branch

Framely platform is a version control system. You can collaborate with multiple members independently without affecting others. When you start building, such as adding or modifying some instances, a **Branch** is automatically created for you based on the current master(we call it **Base**). Then you can work on this branch in isolation from changes that other people are making to the project.

### Branch Changes
While you are working, you can compare the changes you made with **Base** through **Diffs**. During a comparison, if you are not satisfied with these changes or have some new ideas, you can restore your changes by **Revert** operation. If you are satisfied with these changes, you can save these small groups of meaningful changes via **Commit** and prepare for [Testing]().

### Keep Branch in Sync
Typically, when you are working, your teammates may push some changes and merge them into master. The version of master will be updated, which will cause your branch out-of-date. Keeping your branch up to date with the current master can help you catch problems prior. You can synchronize at any time you need via **Rebase**, but it's best to do this before committing and testing. 

### Resolve Merge Conflict 
There are conflicting changes, when people make different changes to the same field of the same component, or when one edits an instance and another deletes it. Sometimes, when you merge branches that have competing changes, you need to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge. You need to resolve all conflicts before you can move to the next step via **Resolve Conflict** by selecting the changes that you want to keep. 

## Open Pull Request

Once you're satisfied with your work, you can open a pull request to tell others about changes you've pushed in a project. Pull requests display diffs to compare the changes you made in your branch against the base master, which indicates you are willing to merge them into master. Others can review your proposed changes and submit reviews by marking Approve or Close.

Pull requests can only be opened when there are differences between branch and master, and you have already committed these differences. Only approved change can be merged into master.

## Terms

- **Branch**: Where you work in isolation from changes that other people are making to the project. One always works with a branch and can keep one active branch for each project.
- **Base**: The latest merged master when the branch was created. Each branch has a base.
- **Rebase**: When the master version is upgraded, synchronizing the latest master to your branch. 
- **Diffs**: Shows you exactly how it differed from the base master.
- **Commit**: Confirm your branch changes and ready to start testing. 
- **Pull Request**: Pull requests display diffs to compare the changes you made in your branch against the base master, which indicates you are willing to merge them into master.

## How to Use

This guide walks you through version control workflow:

### Create Branch
To create branch, you can just modify your project, for example you can create an intent. And then all your work will be done in your branch. 

### View your Changes
1. To view your changes, click **Diff** icon in the right sidebar.

:::

2. This will show all the changes you made, adding, deleting, modifying, which allows you to visually compare the difference between your branch and the base master. **Local** represents your changes on the branch, while **Master** shows what is the original  in base master.

3. If you are done with your work, don't forget to commit  your changes by clicking **Commit** icon on both struct side and lang side. This will prepare for the testing and pull request.

### Sync Up with Master

During your working, if the version of master has changed, the **Rebase** icon in the right sidebar will light up and turn red. 
1. Click the red **Rebase** icon to merge the latest changes from the master.

2. If the **Rebase Conflicts** a field will slide out, this means there is a merge conflict.

3. You have to make a choice, choose one of the two options you want to keep in the final merge. Once you've resolved all the conflicts, click **Resolve Conflicts** as resolved, then you can continue your branch work.

### Review Changes

1. To review changes, you should create a pull request that is ready for review. Head to the **Versions** Page, click P**ull Request** button.

2. When the creation is successful, you can see the pull request created in the version list.

3. Click the pull request item, you can review by yourself or request a review from other person. After you've finished reviewing all the diffs you want in the pull request, click **Approve PR** or **Close PR** to submit your review.

4. When the pull request is approved, you can merge it by yourself. Select the approved pull request you'd like to merge, click **Merge** button.

:::

5. Enter your version tag, click **Save**, the **Merge** process will start. At the same time, a **Rebase** operation will be done automatically to avoid changes being out-of-date.

6. If you are an owner or have admin permissions, you can set the project as protected project. It means pull request authors cannot approve their own pull requests. To set this feature, head to the **Settings** page, enable the **Protected** by turning on the toggle.
