## Guidelines
- Don't make sentences wordy.
- Please break up the long sentence into shorter and simpler sentences.
- Please simplify the language and make it more concise.
- Please add more details to the steps, so that it is easier to follow.
- Please use more transition words or commas to make the relationship between the two sentences clear.
- Please use more transition words and phrases to make the paragraph flow more smoothly.
- Please use `TypeLabel` to identify each type in your instructions. For example, for a frame labeled as "BusinessHours", you can call it the `BusinessHours` frame.

## Requirement of screenshots
- Keep screenshots clear and easy to understand, avoiding any confusion or misleading elements.
- Make sure that screenshot width captures all necessary information without cramming content together.
- Highlight clickable areas and maintain equal white space on both sides in screenshots for clarity.
- Adjust screenshot height as needed, ensuring all essential information is visible to builders.
- Standardize screenshot width to 1680 pixels for a consistent appearance.

## Other consideration
- Let's not use x.x.x to label section, so that we do not have deal with inconsistency when add or remove section.
- We should carefully consider the need for introduce a hyperlink, do we really want reader to go off to new page? If we do not want user to click away, we should do simply explanation on the spot, to improve the flow. Try not to over use link so less distraction for reader.
- Only user numbered item list when the order actually matters, and only at the leaf level, these are local decisions, so it is easy to get right. People generally follow the order anyway.
- Always add overview, so that reader have a sense of why and what, before we throw them into the details of how.
- Use "you" to refer to reader, "we" to writer, and chatbot instead of bot for clarity.
- Use PostgREST, PostgreSQL, OpenCUI.
